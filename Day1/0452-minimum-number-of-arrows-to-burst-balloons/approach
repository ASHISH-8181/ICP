 sort on basis of starting interval
store the first start point in prev arr
intialise cnt with 1
iterate in the array 
mark the point as currStart-(point[i][0]) , currEnd-(points[i][1]), prevStart-(prev[0]),prevEnd-(prev[1])
check for overlapping or not 
if not --> (currstart<prevend) inc the count as we have burst the ballons and change the prev to curr--(point[i])
if overlapping-->// overlap size
prevstart=max(currstart,prevstart);
prevend=min(currend,prevend);

return cnt

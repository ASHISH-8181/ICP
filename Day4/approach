solve using sliding window 
inc the size of window whenever a new character is there (!set.cotains(s.charAt(end))--> add character in set
while inc store the length as length=max(length,end-start+1) --> inc end++;
otherwise
if character is already there then remove the first from set and dec window size;
set.remove(s.charAt(first) first++;
